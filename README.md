Hatch Evaluation Test

SpringBoot app that read IOT devices data, and process throught a pipeline of REST APIs.


It was based on requirements below:
Context

IoT devices send out continuous data which we want to collect (e.g thermostat, heart rate meter,
car fuel readings, etc).
Your task is to build a pipeline via which we can process the IoT data in a scalable manner. In
addition to that, we want to have a secure web service for querying the readings (e.g
average/median/max/min values) of specific sensors or groups of sensors for a specific
timeframe.
We do not expect a production ready system, but it should be a good working prototype. You may
use any publicly available open source tools and libraries, but we prefer if the solution is
Java/Scala based.
Requirements
• Simulate data for at least 3 IoT devices which send out a value every second
• Scalable and extendable to work with more IoT devices
• Fast
• Self-contained Your submission should contain the following:
o Source code
o Short description of the approach and limitations of the implementation
o Instructions on how to run and how to access the service Evaluation criteria
o Ability to transform vague requirements into a working system
o Code quality
o Design scalability
o Robustness of the implementation
